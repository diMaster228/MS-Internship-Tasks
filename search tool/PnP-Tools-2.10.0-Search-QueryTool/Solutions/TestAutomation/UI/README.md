# PnP Test Automation UI #
PnP Test automation is project that does run tests of the PnP Core library and PnP PowerShell against various test environments on a daily basis. These test results are stored in a SQL Azure database and to explore those results we've built a small web application which is available for you to re-use for your internal testing needs.
