title: SharePoint Sandbox Solution scanner (SharePoint.SandBoxTool)
description: Using this command line utility you can scan, download, analyze and if possible fix the sandbox solutions in your SharePoint environment. This tool uses multi-threading to improve performance, uses app-only permissions to be able to access all sites and can deal with throttling in case that would happen.
